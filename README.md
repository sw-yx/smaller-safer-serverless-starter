## Swyx's Smaller Safer Serverless Starter

This is a Preact + TypeScript + Tailwind + Next.js (with API Routes) Starter project.

It uses upcoming Next.js features for extra small bundles:

- polyfillsOptimization: https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/10212
- Module/NoModule support: https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/7563

We have a local fork of `next/babel` because of https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/11675
