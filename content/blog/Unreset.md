title: How and Why to Un-Reset Tailwind's CSS Reset
date: 2020-04-04

Tailwind CSS comes with a great CSS Reset, called [Preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight/#app). It starts with the awesome [Normalize.css project](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), and then nukes all default margins, styling, and borders for every HTML element. This is so that you have a consistent, predictable starting point with which to apply your visual utility classes separate from the semantic element names.

That's great. So why would you want to _unreset_ a CSS Reset?!

## The Why

Without unresetting, here's how this post you're reading would look on [my own demo site](https://github.com/sw-yx/smaller-safer-serverless-starter):

This is because this blogpost is authored in Markdown, processed through [JDown](https://github.com/DanWebb/jdown), and then rendered into our Next.js app with [React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` API](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#dangerouslysetinnerhtml). Despite the name, this is the main way to inject externally generated HTML into Preact/React pages:

```jsx
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.contents }} />
```

However, this content comes _without_ any Tailwind classes, and because I'm writing this in Markdown, there's really [no way to add the Tailwind classes in to each element](https://www.swyx.io/writing/markdown-mistakes/#4-no-syntax-for-adding-classes) - nor really would you want to.

The solution, [prescribed on the Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-base-styles/), is to Add Base Styles for the components you want to render like "normal". Effectively doing a CSS "Un-reset"!

## The How

I'm not the first to this idea - and a quick trip to Google yielded this [Unreset.scss](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ixkaito/unreset-css/master/_unreset.scss) file. Assuming you're using SASS, you could basically copy it over to your `tailwind.scss` and namespace it under an `unreset` class:

```scss
.unreset {
  // paste unreset.scss here!
}
```

And then in your JSX, you can add that `unreset` class in:

```jsx
<div className="unreset" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.contents }} />
```

Job done! Right?

## The How - Tailwind style!

Nah, I still don't love it. First of all, any customization to colors and margins that you've done won't be respected, because you've "Un-Reset" them to [magic numbers](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/939843271768948736). Your blog content will look inconsistent from the rest of your site üí©

The Tailwind Way‚Ñ¢ to do it would be to go through all the `unreset.css` styles and translate them to Tailwind classes as far as possible, so that they will conform as close as possible.

```scss
.unreset {
  a {
    @apply text-blue-700 underline;
  }
  p {
    @apply my-4;
  }
  // etc...
}
```

Since [Tailwind's Preflight CSS Reset](https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@1.2.0/dist/base.css) doesn't reset absolutely _everything_, you should really diff Preflight against `unreset.css` in order to figure out what to unreset, so as not ship excess CSS.

Sound like a chore? It is. **[I've done it for you here!](https://gist.github.com/sw-yx/28c25962485101ca291ec1947b9d0b3e)**. You can also [see it in action on this demo](https://github.com/sw-yx/smaller-safer-serverless-starter).

## Conclusion

Here's my demo site after unresetting:

Of course, like everything Tailwind, feel free to customize to match your exact usecase. I just helped you get started.
